# The Mine Horror Game
I started to make this game in 2013 in parallel with writing my own game engine based on DX 9 + Bullet Physics. 
This repo contains source code only for Windows. Porting to other OS, such Linux, can be done in future.

Currently Ruthenium Game engine supports this features (list may be incomplete):
* Deferred Shading
* GPU Skinning
* HDR Rendering
* FXAA Antialising
* Soft Shadows
* Cacheable Shadows
* Point Lights
* Spot Lights
* Directional Lights
* Volumetric Fog
* Parallax Mapping
* Complex Scene Graph
* Particle Systems
* Soft Particles
* Simple GUI
For this game, there is enough features to make it look fine.
